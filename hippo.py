# We work to offer the lowest possible prices on generic and branded medications,
# regardless of whether you have insurance or not.
# Patients get prescriptions with drug (ndc) and its (quantity) to be filled by
# a Pharmacy (npi). When the patient arrives at the pharmacy with the
# prescription, the pharmacist informs the (price) and submits a new claim.
# Sometimes, the consumer does not return to the pharmacy to get the drugs,
# this will generate a claim revert which should be registered by the pharmacist
# in order to revert (i.e. invalidate) that claim.
